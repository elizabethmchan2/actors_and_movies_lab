# Actors and Movies - Polymorphic Lab

In this lab, you'll start with the solution code from yesterday's actors
and movies lab and add a polymorphic association allowing comments to be
left on both actors and movies.

Come up with a plan based on what you read in the pre-reading.

Work with a partner.

## Bonus

Implement comments by users. Youâ€™ll need to implement authentication.

## Super Bonus

Implement threaded comments. 

* Hint 1: This is also a polymorphic relationship.
* Hint 2: One way to accomplish this is to use [self-joins](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#self-joins).
